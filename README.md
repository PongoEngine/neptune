# Neptune

This is a WIP.

I'm still in the process of defining pretty much everything. The macro is not optimized. The update calls are not optimized. The types of setters are not all defined.

I'm releasing the source so that others can view this project's progress and get excited about macros BECAUSE HAXE IS COOL.

### My goal is to have an alpha release by September 1st with a working example project. Until then feel free to check out the code.
